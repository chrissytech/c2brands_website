            While plugging away in the corporate world, I gained incredible
            experience working with many different brands. From the H&R Block
            Internal Communications Department to the Block Real Estate
            Marketing Department and the Lockton Affinity Marketing Department,
            I worked with hundreds of other well-known brands, businesses, and
            business owners. Our most challenging projects were also my most
            rewarding projects. They allowed me to explore the mind of the
            target audiences. Who are they? What do they want? Why do they care
            about this product?
          </Paragraph1>
          <Paragraph1>
            In 2016, the obvious occurred: so many small businesses were
            struggling because they didn{"'"}t have a solid foundation. They
            didn{"'"}t know the science behind some marketing basics like
            choosing a name, the importance of defining a mission, the value of
            developing a target market avatar. They didn{"'"}t know they needed
            to do these thingsâ€¦and they didn{"'"}t know how.
          </Paragraph1>
          <Paragraph1>
            To help small business owners, my team and I published a 67-page
            book to get startups on track. Business Branding for the
            Non-Designer breaks branding down into easy-to-understand,
            easy-to-execute steps, giving non-designers everything they need to
            create winning brands and successful business marketing.
